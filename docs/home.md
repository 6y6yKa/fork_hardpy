# Hardware testing that simply works

Write your tests for hardware in Python (pytest) and create a reliable testing stand in minutes – with tester web UI, test data collection, for all OS.

## Everything you need for testing
Optional subhead: One test plan from lab to production — same code, same workflow.

## It’s just Python
Write test plans in plain Python. No DSL — easy to review, version, and maintain.

## Operator-friendly steps
Inline instructions, images, confirmations, and data entry. The operator sees exactly what to do — nothing extra.

## Reusable drivers & building blocks
Connect instruments through drivers/adapters and reuse steps across products. Build test flows like LEGO.

## Production-ready
Runs on PCs and SBCs (e.g., Raspberry Pi), works offline, fits CI. Great for fixtures, jigs, and EOL lines.

## Traceability by serial number
Store results and measurements in a structured way: serial → run → steps → metrics. Easy to debug and audit.

# More than just a test script

## Built-in operator flow

HardPy turns your test plan into a guided workflow: step-by-step instructions, photos, confirmations, and data entry. Operators follow the same process every run — less training, fewer mistakes, cleaner results.

## Code annotations (steps that explain themselves)

Some tests need context: what to connect, what “good” looks like, or when to stop. HardPy lets you attach rich notes to each step — text, images, tables, and callouts — right next to the code that runs the measurement.

## StandCloud analytics (optional)

Push test results to StandCloud: traceability by serial number, yield by batch, failure trends, and reruns. Catch production issues early and optimize your test plan with real data.
