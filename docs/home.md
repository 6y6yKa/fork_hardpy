# Hardware testing that simply works

Write your tests for hardware in Python (pytest) and run them through a guided operator UI. Collect data locally or in StandCloud. Works on Windows, Linux, and SBCs.

## Everything you need for testing

One test plan from lab to production - same code, same workflow.

- **Plain Python**
  
    ---

    Write test plans in plain Python. No DSL - easy to review, version, and maintain.

    ---


- **Operator-friendly steps**

    ---

    Inline instructions, images, confirmations, and data entry. Operators see exactly what to do.

    ---

- **Reusable drivers and building blocks**
  
    ---

    Connect instruments through drivers/adapters and reuse steps across products.

    ---

- **Production-ready**
  
    ---

    Runs on PCs and SBCs (e.g., Raspberry Pi), works offline, and fits CI.

    ---

- **Traceability by serial number**
  
    ---

    Store results and measurements in a structured way: serial, run, steps, metrics.

    ---

- **Flexible storage**
  
    ---

    Save results in CouchDB or JSON, and optionally push to StandCloud.

## How it works

1. Write tests in pytest.
2. Add operator steps and annotations.
3. Run from the HardPy operator panel.
4. Store results in CouchDB, JSON, or StandCloud.

## StandCloud analytics (optional)

Track yield, failures, and reruns with production-ready dashboards and serial-level traceability.
