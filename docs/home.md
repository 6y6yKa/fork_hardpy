# Hardware testing that simply works

Write your tests for hardware in Python (pytest) and run them through a guided operator UI. Collect data locally or in StandCloud. Works on Windows, Linux, and SBCs.

## Everything you need for testing

One test plan from lab to production - same code, same workflow.

- <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&#x1F40D;&#xFE0E;</span>&nbsp; **Plain Python**
  
    ---

    Write test plans in plain Python. No DSL - easy to review, version, and maintain.

    ---


- <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&#x1F4CB;&#xFE0E;</span>&nbsp; **Operator-friendly steps**

    ---

    Inline instructions, images, confirmations, and data entry. Operators see exactly what to do.

    ---

- <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&#x1F9F1;&#xFE0E;</span>&nbsp; **Reusable drivers and building blocks**
  
    ---

    Connect instruments through drivers/adapters and reuse steps across products.

    ---

- <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&#x1F3ED;&#xFE0E;</span>&nbsp; **Production-ready**
  
    ---

    Runs on PCs and SBCs (e.g., Raspberry Pi), works offline, and fits CI.

    ---

- <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&#x1F3F7;&#xFE0E;</span>&nbsp; **Traceability by serial number**
  
    ---

    Store results and measurements in a structured way: serial, run, steps, metrics.

    ---

- <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&#x1F5C4;&#xFE0E;</span>&nbsp; **Flexible storage**
  
    ---

    Save results in CouchDB or JSON, and optionally push to StandCloud.

    ---

- <span style="font-size: 1.3em;">&#x1F4CA;&#xFE0E;</span>&nbsp; **StandCloud analytics (optional)**

    ---

    Track yield, failures, and reruns with production-ready dashboards and serial-level traceability.

## Trusted by teams shipping hardware

HardPy is used by engineers building production test rigs and end-of-line stations. Pair it with StandCloud to store results by serial number, track yield, and catch failure trends early.
